Azure SharePoint Online File Uploader
=====================================

Runs an Azure web role that authenticates with the SPO STS and lets the user upload files to/view existing files in a library.

You should probably read the associated article [here on MSDN](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2012/06/12/building-azure-and-sharepoint-applications-an-introduction.aspx, "Building Azure and SharePoint Applications: An Introduction").

Any contributions welcome!
